           <p>They say love at first sight doesn't exist, but I know better. I know it all started the day I first saw you. Ito yung araw na orientation palang ng HTS Mataas Na Kahoy, sa lahat ng babaeng naroroon ay sayo ako napatingin tapos hinihiling ko na ka strand kita or kaklase man lang kasi wala pa ko kilala that time.Sa sobrang bait ni Lord sakin or tadhana lang talaga, ay kaklase at ka strand pa kita,Wahahahahahaha.So ayun Nakita ko name mo sa pinto ng room kasi separated each strand,as always hinanap ko agad account mo sa fb tas Nakita ko profile mo and shet bat ganun ka kaganda,Your smile was so radiant and mesmerizing, I couldn't help but be drawn to you.I kept seeing you in my mind for days, remembering your beauty, your angelic presence and how that translated into an undeniable attraction.May balak sana ako na message ka kaso nahihiya ako(kunwari shy type tarantado naman). The next time I saw you, I realized this was more than a mere infatuation. That's when we first talked. It was as if we've known each other for many years, I felt so comfortable with you (even though I am generally shy). For many days I kept reliving our first conversation in my mind, word for word. I kept seeing your adorable face and I knew I had to see you again, to be around you, to be with you.Napakaswerte ko siguro dahil nakilala kita at kung di dahil sayo ay lagi sana akong absent sa school, no motivation, walang gana mag aral etc.So ayun na nga I remember natatandaan ko, yung first convo natin,at siguro kung di ko naging teacher si Sir Bilog ay hindi tayo magiging close dahil organization management ang dahilan kung bakit tayo naging close.Tapos ayun, unti unti na ko naging close close tayo to the point na naaasar n akita at napagtitripan kita(ganun ako makipag kulitan ,tamang asar asar lang).Tapos ito yung part na ayaw kong mangyari ngunit sa kasamaang palad ay nangyari na.Nalaman ng mga kaibigan ko na crush kita,after many months of not telling my crush to them,nalaman nila dahil sa mga katarantaduhan nila.Enough with this bs, let me get to the point of this letter,im writing this letter to say thank you and sorry,Thank you because you became my temporary happiness and I will always be grateful for that, Thank you for letting me learn the consequences of pouring out all the love I have for you, only to feel empty when you decided my love will never be enough. Thank you, for constantly giving me reasons to leave even after trying to ignore all the red flags.You’re always popping up. In places that you’ve never been. In my midnight dreams. In my poems and writing. In casual conversations. In my unspoken words.I can breathe now. For a while there, I couldn’t. I couldn’t comprehend that we had an ending. Because if it’s true love, it always finds a way to live, right? And if it were meant to be, it would be.But we aren’t.What we had was special. What we had was something that I will never forget. But what we had is long gone. What we had is done. I don’t know why it took me so long for that to latch onto my heart. I don’t know why it took me so long to accept that fate isn’t in the stars for us. Fate isn’t on our side. Maybe it never was.Maybe I had to take so much time missing you, for it to really hit me. Maybe I had to take so much time writing about you, to get you out of my system. To get the idea of you and me out of my head and my brain and my fingers.Maybe I had to cry my eyes out for you, for so long, in order to finally get to this stage. This stage of acceptance. This stage of now knowing, that it’s done.I had to let you go. To let the hope go. To let the pain flow out of me. I had to take control of my destiny that will never be with you. I had to let go of the past.I wish we could have been friends. We tried. We gave it a go. But, it wasn’t enough for me. It wasn’t fulfilling. It just broke me and over and over again. It hurt too much to talk to you and not remember how to unsay ‘I love you’.So, if you’re reading this…I’m sorry I, . But you’re happy. No more annoying renz na lagi ka tinatarantado and always starting a non sense conversation,no more renz na iniistorbo ka sa oras ng iyong pahinga(sadboi yarn?).And finally, I want to be happy too. Without the past always getting in the way. Without you always showing up, pulling me back all the way in.And now, I know that I deserve to find someone. Mahirap man gawin pero kailangan na talaga,this wasn’t the first time im doing this thing,kinaya ko nga nung una,ngayon pa kaya?I guess this is also the time to say the truth,ako at si anna ay iisa lang,I’m very sorry for doing that you,I really fucking hate myself for doing that bs,pretending to be another person just to talk to someone I like?like wtf tapos puro kasinuwalingan pinagsasabi?damn I was really a bad person for that but I deeply apologize for that,kasalanan mor in kasi,I still remember natatandaan mko na nung prinank kita ay sabi mo sa akin na di na ulit kita mapaprank,I took that personally,,the result says it all.So ayun almost 1000 words na tong kagaguhan na to,one final message ko sayo(mahaba-haba to konting tiis nalng).SO ayun na  nga, Merry Christmas,sana matupad lahat ng wish mo this year and sana maging successful person ka someday and sana napasaya kita kahit konti lang,Goodluck sa journey mo sa life,always remember na every problem has a lesson to teach us that we will always remember,Keep on moving,never give up,if you feel like quitting or giving up just take a rest, walang masama sa magpahinga,life is not a race di ito paunahan maging successful.You don’t always have to be strong,ok lng umiyak or maging malungkot and have negative thoughts, di naman maiiwasan yan,nobody’s perfect ganyan din ako.Not giving up on yourself is what it’s all about,it doesn’t matter how long it takes.It’s the end result that counts.They say love at first sight doesn't exist, but I know better. I know it all started the day I first saw you. Ito yung araw na orientation palang ng HTS Mataas Na Kahoy, sa lahat ng babaeng naroroon ay sayo ako napatingin tapos hinihiling ko na ka strand kita or kaklase man lang kasi wala pa ko kilala that time.Sa sobrang bait ni Lord sakin or tadhana lang talaga, ay kaklase at ka strand pa kita,Wahahahahahaha.So ayun Nakita ko name mo sa pinto ng room kasi separated each strand,as always hinanap ko agad account mo sa fb tas Nakita ko profile mo and shet bat ganun ka kaganda,Your smile was so radiant and mesmerizing, I couldn't help but be drawn to you.I kept seeing you in my mind for days, remembering your beauty, your angelic presence and how that translated into an undeniable attraction.May balak sana ako na message ka kaso nahihiya ako(kunwari shy type tarantado naman).

I kept seeing your adorable face and I knew I had to see you again, to be around you, to be with you.Napakaswerte ko siguro dahil nakilala kita at kung di dahil sayo ay lagi sana akong absent sa school, no motivation, walang gana mag aral etc.So ayun na nga I remember natatandaan ko, yung first convo natin,at siguro kung di ko naging teacher si Sir Bilog ay hindi tayo magiging close dahil organization management ang dahilan kung bakit tayo naging close.Tapos ayun, unti unti na ko naging close close tayo to the point na naaasar n akita at napagtitripan kita(ganun ako makipag kulitan ,tamang asar asar lang).Tapos ito yung part na ayaw kong mangyari ngunit sa kasamaang palad ay nangyari na.Nalaman ng mga kaibigan ko na crush kita,after many months of not telling my crush to them,nalaman nila dahil sa mga katarantaduhan nila.Enough with this bs, let me get to the point of this letter,im writing this letter to say thank you and sorry,Thank you because you became my temporary happiness and I will always be grateful for that, Thank you for letting me learn the consequences of pouring out all the love I have for you, only to feel empty when you decided my love will never be enough. Thank you, for constantly giving me reasons to leave even after trying to ignore all the red flags.You’re always popping up. In places that you’ve never been. In my midnight dreams. In my poems and writing. In casual conversations. In my unspoken words.I can breathe now. For a while there, I couldn’t. I couldn’t comprehend that we had an ending. Because if it’s true love, it always finds a way to live, right? And if it were meant to be, it would be.But we aren’t.What we had was special. What we had was something that I will never forget. But what we had is long gone. What we had is done. I don’t know why it took me so long for that to latch onto my heart. I don’t know why it took me so long to accept that fate isn’t in the stars for us. Fate isn’t on our side. Maybe it never was.Maybe I had to take so much time missing you, for it to really hit me. Maybe I had to take so much time writing about you, to get you out of my system. To get the idea of you and me out of my head and my brain and my fingers.Maybe I had to cry my eyes out for you, for so long, in order to finally get to this stage. This stage of acceptance. This stage of now knowing, that it’s done.I had to let you go. To let the hope go. To let the pain flow out of me. I had to take control of my destiny that will never be with you. I had to let go of the past.I wish we could have been friends. We tried. We gave it a go. But, it wasn’t enough for me. It wasn’t fulfilling. It just broke me and over and over again. It hurt too much to talk to you and not remember how to unsay ‘I love you’.So, if you’re reading this…I’m sorry I, . But you’re happy. No more annoying renz na lagi ka tinatarantado and always starting a non sense conversation,no more renz na iniistorbo ka sa oras ng iyong pahinga(sadboi yarn?).And finally, I want to be happy too. Without the past always getting in the way. Without you always showing up, pulling me back all the way in.And now, I know that I deserve to find someone. Mahirap man gawin pero kailangan na talaga,this wasn’t the first time im doing this thing,kinaya ko nga nung una,ngayon pa kaya?I guess this is also the time to say the truth,ako at si anna ay iisa lang,I’m very sorry for doing that you,I really fucking hate myself for doing that bs,pretending to be another person just to talk to someone I like?like wtf tapos puro kasinuwalingan pinagsasabi?damn I was really a bad person for that but I deeply apologize for that,kasalanan mor in kasi,I still remember natatandaan mko na nung prinank kita ay sabi mo sa akin na di na ulit kita mapaprank,I took that personally,,the result says it all.So ayun almost 1000 words na tong kagaguhan na to,one final message ko sayo(mahaba-haba to konting tiis nalng).SO ayun na nga, Merry Christmas,sana matupad lahat ng wish mo this year and sana maging successful person ka someday and sana napasaya kita kahit konti lang,Goodluck sa journey mo sa life,always remember na every problem has a lesson to teach us that we will always remember,Keep on moving,never give up,if you feel like quitting or giving up just take a rest, walang masama sa magpahinga,life is not a race di ito paunahan maging successful.You don’t always have to be strong,ok lng umiyak or maging malungkot and have negative thoughts, di naman maiiwasan yan,nobody’s perfect ganyan din ako.Not giving up on yourself is what it’s all about,it doesn’t matter how long it takes.It’s the end result that counts.They say love at first sight doesn't exist, but I know better. I know it all started the day I first saw you. Ito yung araw na orientation palang ng HTS Mataas Na Kahoy, sa lahat ng babaeng naroroon ay sayo ako napatingin tapos hinihiling ko na ka strand kita or kaklase man lang kasi wala pa ko kilala that time.Sa sobrang bait ni Lord sakin or tadhana lang talaga, ay kaklase at ka strand pa kita,Wahahahahahaha.So ayun Nakita ko name mo sa pinto ng room kasi separated each strand,as always hinanap ko agad account mo sa fb tas Nakita ko profile mo and shet bat ganun ka kaganda,Your smile was so radiant and mesmerizing, I couldn't help but be drawn to you.I kept seeing you in my mind for days, remembering your beauty, your angelic presence and how that translated into an undeniable attraction.May balak sana ako na message ka kaso nahihiya ako(kunwari shy type tarantado naman).

I don’t know why it took me so long to accept that fate isn’t in the stars for us. Fate isn’t on our side. Maybe it never was.Maybe I had to take so much time missing you, for it to really hit me. Maybe I had to take so much time writing about you, to get you out of my system. To get the idea of you and me out of my head and my brain and my fingers.Maybe I had to cry my eyes out for you, for so long, in order to finally get to this stage. This stage of acceptance. This stage of now knowing, that it’s done.I had to let you go. To let the hope go. To let the pain flow out of me. I had to take control of my destiny that will never be with you. I had to let go of the past.I wish we could have been friends. We tried. We gave it a go. But, it wasn’t enough for me. It wasn’t fulfilling. It just broke me and over and over again. It hurt too much to talk to you and not remember how to unsay ‘I love you’.So, if you’re reading this…I’m sorry I, . But you’re happy. No more annoying renz na lagi ka tinatarantado and always starting a non sense conversation,no more renz na iniistorbo ka sa oras ng iyong pahinga(sadboi yarn?).And finally, I want to be happy too. Without the past always getting in the way. Without you always showing up, pulling me back all the way in.And now, I know that I deserve to find someone. Mahirap man gawin pero kailangan na talaga,this wasn’t the first time im doing this thing,kinaya ko nga nung una,ngayon pa kaya?I guess this is also the time to say the truth,ako at si anna ay iisa lang,I’m very sorry for doing that you,I really fucking hate myself for doing that bs,pretending to be another person just to talk to someone I like?like wtf tapos puro kasinuwalingan pinagsasabi?damn I was really a bad person for that but I deeply apologize for that,kasalanan mor in kasi,I still remember natatandaan mko na nung prinank kita ay sabi mo sa akin na di na ulit kita mapaprank,I took that personally,,the result says it all.So ayun almost 1000 words na tong kagaguhan na to,one final message ko sayo(mahaba-haba to konting tiis nalng).SO ayun na nga, Merry Christmas,sana matupad lahat ng wish mo this year and sana maging successful person ka someday and sana napasaya kita kahit konti lang,Goodluck sa journey mo sa life,always remember na every problem has a lesson to teach us that we will always remember,Keep on moving,never give up,if you feel like quitting or giving up just take a rest, walang masama sa magpahinga,life is not a race di ito paunahan maging successful.You don’t always have to be strong,ok lng umiyak or maging malungkot and have negative thoughts, di naman maiiwasan yan,nobody’s perfect ganyan din ako.Not giving up on yourself is what it’s all about,it doesn’t matter how long it takes.It’s the end result that counts.They say love at first sight doesn't exist, but I know better. I know it all started the day I first saw you. Ito yung araw na orientation palang ng HTS Mataas Na Kahoy, sa lahat ng babaeng naroroon ay sayo ako napatingin tapos hinihiling ko na ka strand kita or kaklase man lang kasi wala pa ko kilala that time.Sa sobrang bait ni Lord sakin or tadhana lang talaga, ay kaklase at ka strand pa kita,Wahahahahahaha.So ayun Nakita ko name mo sa pinto ng room kasi separated each strand,as always hinanap ko agad account mo sa fb tas Nakita ko profile mo and shet bat ganun ka kaganda,Your smile was so radiant and mesmerizing, I couldn't help but be drawn to you.I kept seeing you in my mind for days, remembering your beauty, your angelic presence and how that translated into an undeniable attraction.May balak sana ako na message ka kaso nahihiya ako(kunwari shy type tarantado naman). The next time I saw you, I realized this was more than a mere infatuation. That's when we first talked. It was as if we've known each other for many years, I felt so comfortable with you (even though I am generally shy). For many days I kept reliving our first conversation in my mind, word for word. I kept seeing your adorable face and I knew I had to see you again, to be around you, to be with you.Napakaswerte ko siguro dahil nakilala kita at kung di dahil sayo ay lagi sana akong absent sa school, no motivation, walang gana mag aral etc.So ayun na nga I remember natatandaan ko, yung first convo natin,at siguro kung di ko naging teacher si Sir Bilog ay hindi tayo magiging close dahil organization management ang dahilan kung bakit tayo naging close.Tapos ayun, unti unti na ko naging close close tayo to the point na naaasar n akita at napagtitripan kita(ganun ako makipag kulitan ,tamang asar asar lang).Tapos ito yung part na ayaw kong mangyari ngunit sa kasamaang palad ay nangyari na.Nalaman ng mga kaibigan ko na crush kita,after many months of not telling my crush to them,nalaman nila dahil sa mga katarantaduhan nila.Enough with this bs, let me get to the point of this letter,im writing this letter to say thank you and sorry,Thank you because you became my temporary happiness and I will always be grateful for that, Thank you for letting me learn the consequences of pouring out all the love I have for you, only to feel empty when you decided my love will never be enough. Thank you, for constantly giving me reasons to leave even after trying to ignore all the red flags.You’re always popping up. In places that you’ve never been. In my midnight dreams. In my poems and writing. In casual conversations. In my unspoken words.I can breathe now. For a while there, I couldn’t. I couldn’t comprehend that we had an ending. Because if it’s true love, it always finds a way to live, right? And if it were meant to be, it would be.But we aren’t.What we had was special. What we had was something that I will never forget.
